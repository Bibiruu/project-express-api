# Project Express API

* Google cloud installation , graph reading + connecting it to github
* Created a RESTful API.
* Created routes
* Returned a collection of results
* Returned a single result 
* Handle when the item doesn't exist and return some useful data in the response.
* Version control very active

* The JSON data was from kaggle about Blockchain JObs in India at 2022 =)
* Converted the CSV file to a JSON through a convertor.

Next step would be creating a pagination with an interface to display certain slice of a data.


## View it live

 * Use these end points/queries to see it in action

/location?salarylowerlimit=200000                       *query (change the digit to 5 for example you see a different extraction =)
